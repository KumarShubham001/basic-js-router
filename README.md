## Technologies
* HTML
* JS

## Setup
* Inside your head tag define all the templates.
* Create a section/div in your body and give it an ID as 'appRoot'. (Excat name is important)
* Include the router.js file in your project html file in the bottom (or where ever the fuck you wantðŸ˜‰).
* Next include all the routes your project has in the format
Yea, thats it. Router is all setup ðŸ˜Ž.

## Code Examples
Basic example of template:
`<script type="text/html" id="home"><!-- Here goe the basic/ advanced html tags to get rendered runtime --></script>`
Here id='home' is the same id that will be referenced while rendering the component runtime.
 
Basic example of Route defination:
`route('/', 'home', function () {});`
Here '/' is the route where the home template should get rendered, 'home' is the id of the template that will be rendered.
